# World Graph

**World Graph** is a visualization tool designed to represent complex geographical and statistical data on an interactive world map. The project aims to offer a clear and intuitive way to explore relationships between different countries or regions, such as trade routes, population density, economic data, and more.

## Features

- **Interactive World Map**: Zoom in and out, click on countries or regions for detailed data visualization.
- **Data Layers**: Toggle different data layers (e.g., population, GDP, climate, etc.) to explore various datasets.
- **Graphical Representation**: Visualize connections between countries or data points with graph-style links, showing relationships such as trade routes or migration patterns.
- **Filter and Search**: Easily filter data by country, region, or specific criteria.
- **Real-Time Data (if applicable)**: Integrates with APIs to display up-to-date data.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Base structure of the web application.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (D3.js, Leaflet, or Three.js)**: To manage interactive visualizations and maps.
- **Node.js/Express**: Backend (if applicable).
- **MongoDB/MySQL**: For storing geographical and statistical data (replace with actual database technology).
- **API Integration**: Fetch real-time data from external sources (e.g., REST APIs or GraphQL).
- **Graph Theory**: Implemented to represent relationships between countries/regions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (if applicable)
- **MongoDB/MySQL** (or another database)
- **Git**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ConnorSapphire/world-graph.git
   cd world-graph
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Usage

- **Exploration**: Navigate the world map, select countries, and view detailed data.
- **Data Layers**: Switch between different datasets (e.g., population, economic statistics).
- **Graph Relations**: View connections and relationships represented graphically.
