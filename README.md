# World Graph

**World Graph** is a visualization tool designed to represent complex geographical and statistical data on an interactive world map. The project aims to offer a clear and intuitive way to explore relationships between different countries or regions, such as trade routes, data transfer, nodes in a network and more.

## Features

- **Interactive World Map**: Zoom in and out for detailed data visualization.
- **Data Layers**: View in depth information on the status of different data, such as whether a node is online.
- **Graphical Representation**: Visualize connections between countries or data points with graph-style links, showing relationships such as trade routes or migration patterns.
- **Real-Time Data (if applicable)**: Integrates with APIs to display up-to-date data.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Base structure of the web application.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (Three.js)**: To manage interactive visualizations and maps.
- **Node.js/Express**: Backend (if applicable).
- **API Integration**: Fetch real-time data from external sources (e.g., REST APIs or GraphQL).
- **Graph Theory**: Implemented to represent relationships between countries/regions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**
- **Git**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ConnorSapphire/world-graph.git
   cd world-graph
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Usage

- **Exploration**: Navigate the world map and view detailed data.
- **Data Layers**: Switch between different datasets (e.g., trade routes, data transfer).
- **Graph Relations**: View connections and relationships represented graphically.
